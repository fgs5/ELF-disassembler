# ELF-disassembler
Main goal of this project was to investigate into the structure of ELF-files, so provided code contains 
duplicate and is really far from perfection.

Notice that this is a **study** project, so use the provided code as your own homework or production 
at your own risk. Current program realizes a disassembler of 
[ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format)-files in java.

Following code must extract executable part of ELF-file and convert it to assembler commands. 
To run a project simply compile it and execute Main.class provided with the names of input and
output files.
